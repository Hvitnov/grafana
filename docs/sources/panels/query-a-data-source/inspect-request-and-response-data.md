# Inspect query request and response data

After you have written a query, inspect the data that the system returns to ensure it's correct. Fine-tuning your query ensures that your visualization is providing the required data.

## Before you begin

- [Add a panel to a dashboard]({{< relref "../working-with-panels/add-panel.md" >}}).
- [Add a query]({{< relref "../query-a-data-source/add-a-query.md" >}}).

**To inspect query request and response data**:

1. Edit the panel that contains the query you want to export.
1. In the query editor, click **Query Inspector**.
1. Click **Refresh**.

   The panel populates with response data.

1. Make adjustments, as necessary and re-run the query.
1. To download the query request and response data, click the **Copy to clipboard** icon and paste the results into another application.
